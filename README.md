## Libraries Used
I used <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> for the CSS. I also used two of their Building Blocks to style the site: for the <a href="http://zurb.com/building-blocks/f6-top-bar">top bar</a>, and the <a href="http://zurb.com/building-blocks/log-in-form">form</a>.

Additionally, the word list was scraped from <a href="http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/">Paul Noll's list</a> of English words.

## Overview
Web app that generates a password in an <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">xkcd</a> fashion. The form options allow the user to select between 1 and 9 words, separated by either a comma, hyphen, period, underscore, or space; additionally, the user can choose between 1 and 9 numbers and between 1 and 9 symbols to append to the end of the password.
